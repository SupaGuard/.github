**SupaGuard** is an AI-native synthetic monitoring platform that catches production issues before your customers do. We combine intelligent test creation, global execution from 20+ regions, and smart failure classification to eliminate alert fatigue—so your team can focus on building, not firefighting.

Unlike traditional monitoring that relies on real user traffic or brittle scripted tests, SupaGuard uses AI to automatically generate and maintain Playwright tests, intelligently classify failures by business impact, and only alert when issues persist across multiple regions. Every failure comes with session recordings, network traces, and deep debugging context—giving you everything you need to fix fast.
